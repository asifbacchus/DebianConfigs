# Enter your desired NTP servers here.  I'm in Canada so I like using:
#   time.nrc.ca time.chu.nrc.ca
# Other great options are your local ntp.org pool. In Canada:
#   0.ca.pool.ntp.org 1.ca.pool.ntp.org 2.ca.pool.ntp.org 3.ca.pool.ntp.org
# You can find all ntp.org server pools at https://www.ntppool.org/zone/@ and
# then navigate to your closest region.
# I've set this file to use the 'universal' global pools by default
