Files to be added/changed in /etc/skel

This folder contains the base 'template' files from which .bashrc, .profile, etc. are generated for new users.
Changes made to these templates will be applied to all NEW users.
These files can also be manually copied to existing users' home directories to apply changes.

*** ROOT user is NOT based off these templates
